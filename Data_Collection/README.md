These are pre-processing and data collection scripts that you would run before transfering to Compute Canada. Any of these steps can be done manually but should be avoided unless it's necessary. These are all powershell scripts so should be saved as .ps1. The push and pull scripts helps facilitate data transfer from hardware to hardware. The sorting scripts creates session folders for studies that do not generate them by default. This makes data processing easier downstream.
