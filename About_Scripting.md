## IMPORTANT

- When running any script, try it on a test model first before actually using it on the real data. You should avoid running any scripts on shared files unless you understand what it does. For best practice you should probably not run any scripts in the projects folder at all. Always copy files to your own scratch to use them. For all these files remember to check the pathways. 


## BASH (.sh)

- You should save any bash code as a script using the .sh extension instead of running them in the terminal directory as it may have unintended affects. Remember that you need to add execute permission to the file with chmod in order to run the script. 

## About PowerShell Files (.ps1)

- You should be careful when running scripts outside the powershell terminal unless you have signed it. If you run it without doing so, the system might recognize it as foreign and treat it as malware. Since you likely would not have admin privileges on lab devices, it would probably be easier to just write it in powershell ISE and then save it as .ps1. Learn about execution policies before running ps1 scripts.
