Behavioural data are sent from a local device so they use powershell. MRI data are pulled directly from the TONI server so the scripts use bash. Using SSHFS I was able to transfer raw MRI data using my personal laptop without downloading the actual DICOMS. I prefer using this software as it allows me to automate data transfer between servers just like how I programmed data transfer from local client machines.
