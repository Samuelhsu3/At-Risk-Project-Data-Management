# Data-Management-Documentation

I took the time to recover some of the more important scripts that have been used for data migration and added them in the scripts section.
  -Some of these are still being used while others are just there as backup.
  -Older versions that have been retired are in the Legacy code folder.
The guide on using the DashBoard and other information about the project can also be found in the Data Management folder. 
I will continue to add to the data transfer folder as we finalize the data structure.
