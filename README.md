# Data-Management-Documentation

Not everything I have ever wrote are saved here but almost everything you will ever need should be here. The work flow of Data Collection -> Data Transfer -> Data Tracking -> Data Management has never been consistent but I have done my best in automating as much as I can. File conducting data validation I realized that errors made during any of these steps occurs much more often then you would expect. 

I took the time to recover some of the more important scripts that were used for the data migration project and added them to the [saved scripts folder](Data_Management/Saved_Scripts).
Some are still being used while others are there as reference. 
Older versions that have been retired are in the [Legacy Code Folder](Legacy_Code).
Any scripts that are actively being used are saved in the [Data Management Folder](Data_Management).
The guide on using the [DashBoard](DashBoard_Guide.ipynb) and other information about the project can be found in the main folder. The guide on server mounting and ssh keys can be found in the [Data Transfer Folder](Data_Transfer), along with the ps1 scripts designed to be run before transfer. I will continue to add to both folders as I finalize the data transfer and handling protocol. 
You can save these scripts and test them out in your own scratch folder but remember to replace pathways if applicable. The [Documentation Notebook](Documentation.ipynb) summarizes everything pretty well and references most (but not all) of the scripts within its explanation. 

  
  Best of Luck,
