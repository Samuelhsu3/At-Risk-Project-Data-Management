# Data-Management-Documentation

I took the time to recover some of the more important scripts that have been used for the data migration project and added them to the saved scripts folder.
A few scripts that are still being used for tracking are also in there as reference. 
Older versions that have been retired are in the Legacy code folder.
The guide on using the DashBoard and other information about the project can be found in the two notebooks. 
I will continue to add to the data transfer folder as I finalize the data transfer protocol.
